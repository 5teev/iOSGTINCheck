# iOSGTINCheck

The iOS app in this project presents a simple UI over the basic GTIN validation algorithm. I wanted to contribute a Swift version to the project at https://github.com/TheGeekExplorer/GTIN-Validation but thought iOS developers might prefer a fuller rendering of the algorithm in ways they might find more useful.

See https://www.gtin.info to learn more about GTINs. See https://www.gtin.info/check-digit-calculator/ to learn more about the validation algorithm.

If you're only interested in a Swift implementation of the validation algorithm, see file [CheckGTIN.swift](https://github.com/5teev/iOSGTINCheck/blob/main/CheckGTINApp/CheckGTIN.swift)
